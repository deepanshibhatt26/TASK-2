# Superstore Sales Data Visualization 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key sales and profitability metrics for a fictional retail superstore. The insights are drawn from transactional data across multiple U.S. regions.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Consumer Segment leads in total sales, accounting for 51% of all revenue.
- Technology is the most profitable product category, significantly outperforming Furniture and Office Supplies.
- Tables in the Furniture category contribute to the highest losses.
- Texas and Illinois appear as high-performing states, while some southern states show low or negative profits.
- Bottom 20 Products identified to spotlight underperforming SKUs for possible discontinuation or strategic review.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Combines multiple advanced Tableau features: filters, hierarchical bar charts, geographic mapping, and interactive dashboards.
- Provides both high-level summary metrics and granular product-level insights.
- Highlights actionable decisions through data storytelling (e.g., identifying loss-making products).

1. Open `Store Sales Data.twb` using **Tableau Desktop**.
2. Connect to `Sample - Superstore.csv` if Tableau prompts for the data source.
3. Explore filters, maps, and individual visualizations in the dashboard.
4. Use dashboard interactivity (e.g., filter by year or region) to customize views.
